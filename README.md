# Bean_leaf_deep_learning
 Using Kaggle data (1034 training, 133 test images), the study categorizes beans into healthy, angular leaf spots, and rust. DenseNet121 with fine-tuning yields 96.09% accuracy, emphasizing its efficacy in disease detection. This has crucial implications for deploying deep learning in agriculture, curbing crop losses, and securing food resources.
